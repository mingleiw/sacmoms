# Design: SacMoms

## The goal

Help a parent or caregiver, on any given day, decide where to take the kids —
**without making them do the searching.** Northern California, not one county.

The benchmark is Marin Mommies. Two things about it matter:

- It works because **a human editor curates one county**. Everything within twenty
  minutes, so the reader never asks "is this too far."
- Scaling that model to nine counties means roughly nine times the editorial
  labour. That is the reason nobody has beaten it Bay-Area-wide. It is a
  content-supply problem, not a design problem.

So the bet is: **automated aggregation + personalisation beats editorial breadth.**
The site should answer, not list.

## Decisions

| # | Decision | Chosen |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Content engine | Aggregate from public sources automatically |
| 2 | Where it runs | Scheduled workflow; agent refreshes nightly |
| 3 | Trust gate | Hard provenance — no source URL, no publish |
| 4 | Source allowlist | All three categories from day one |
| 5 | Data model | Three types: events, places, seasonal |
| 6 | Geography | Home location set once, sort by distance |
| 7 | Homepage | Short ranked shortlist — "Today, near you" |
| 8 | Ranking inputs | Weather-aware |
| 9 | Age | No profile — tag items, parent filters |
| 10 | First slice | Prove the pipeline end-to-end on a few sources |
| 11 | Nightly job | Agent-first, crystallise into parsers as sources prove out |

### Why the non-obvious ones

**3 — Hard provenance.** An agent generating listings nightly is a fabrication
risk. It will confidently emit "Toddler Storytime, 10:30am, Berkeley Public
Library" whether or not it read that anywhere, and a parent will drive there.
So: every item carries the URL it was read from, that URL must be on the
allowlist, and the build drops anything failing schema or provenance. Each
listing shows its source so a parent can verify in one tap.

Corollary: **if a source fails to fetch, keep the last known-good data.** Silent
data loss is worse than slightly stale data.

**5 — Seasonal as a first-class type.** Arguably just a date-ranged event, but
making it its own type forces a **required validity window**, so it self-retires.
A pumpkin patch still listed in December is the fastest way to look abandoned.
Structural beats disciplined.

**6 — Distance over regions.** "East Bay" spans Richmond to Fremont, about fifty
miles. A region filter cannot answer "is this worth the drive," which is the
actual question. Home location is stored in `localStorage`, never leaves the
browser, so **ranking runs client-side.**

**8 — Weather.** In a region where it is 55°F and fogged in at Ocean Beach while
85°F in Walnut Creek, and where half the year is a rainy season, today's forecast
is the most decision-changing fact available. Open-Meteo needs no API key, is
called client-side, and **must degrade silently to the plain ranking on failure.**

**9 — No age profile.** Chosen deliberately for a zero-friction first visit.
Known cost: the shortlist loses its second-strongest signal, so a toddler
lap-sit can surface for a parent of a nine-year-old. Mitigation, pending
confirmation: remember the age chip they last tapped, the way we remember
location. Never ask — just don't make them re-tap it every visit.

**4 — Broad sources day one.** Chosen over a library-first ramp. Consequence:
with ~40 sources you cannot eyeball whether last night's run worked, so
**per-source health tracking is part of the build, not a follow-up.** Each run
records per source: fetched, items found, items rejected, and why.

## Architecture

```
nightly cron (GitHub Actions)

      ├── read sources/registry.json      name, url, region, type, allowed domain
      ├── agent extracts candidate items  agent-first; freeze stable ones into parsers

      ├── read JSON
      ├── home location from localStorage
      ├── weather from Open-Meteo (degrades silently)
      └── rank → shortlist, then full list
```

No server, no database, no vendor. The site stays a fast static page that reads
JSON files.

## Data model

Three types sharing a common core:

```jsonc
{
  "id": "stable-hash",
  "type": "event | place | seasonal",
  "title": "Preschool Storytime",
  "venue": "Belvedere Tiburon Library",
  "city": "Tiburon",
  "region": "marin",
  "lat": 37.87, "lon": -122.46,     // required: distance ranking
  "ages": "2–5",                     // display + filter, not a profile
  "indoor": true,
  "blurb": "…",
  "sourceUrl": "https://…",          // REQUIRED — no publish without it
  "fetchedAt": "2026-09-16T08:00:00Z"
}
```

Type-specific:

- **event** — `day` (0–6) + `time` for weekly recurrence, or a specific `date`
- **place** — no schedule; always open
- **seasonal** — `validFrom` / `validUntil`, **required**, auto-expires

### Editorial rule

**No opening hours, admission prices or one-off dates written by hand.** They
change constantly and a stale value sends a family on a wasted trip. Items carry
things that rarely change plus a map link that is always current.

---

## Sequencing

**First slice — prove the pipeline.** Pick 3–5 sources across the three types.
Build the registry, agent extraction, the provenance validator, published JSON,
and render through the existing UI.

This attacks the only genuinely unproven assumption — *can an agent reliably pull
real, correctly-dated items out of heterogeneous sources, at a nightly cost worth
paying* — while it is still cheap to find out. It answers three things: real
per-night cost, true error rate, and whether "no source URL, no publish" rejects
half the output.

Weather, distance ranking and the shortlist come **after** there is genuine data
to rank. They are conventional work; the pipeline is the risk.

---

## Blockers

1. **Actions token is clamped read-only on this fork.** A nightly job committing
   JSON needs `contents: write`. Already observed: a workflow died with
   `Resource not accessible by integration` despite declaring permissions.
   Fix: Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions → **Read and write**.
2. **API key secret** for the agent in CI.
3. **"Meta Muse"** — named as the day-one data source; term not yet explained.
   Its output format determines the schema to build against.
4. ~~No outbound web in the authoring environment.~~ **Wrong.** `WebSearch`
   routes server-side and works; only `curl` and `WebFetch` go through the
   sandbox proxy and are blocked. Research can happen here. Fetching a specific
   URL to parse still cannot, so extraction code is still only testable in CI,
   and the pipeline should still fail closed.

## Sacramento added

Elk Grove is the intended first city, so the site now covers the Sacramento
area as a sixth region: nine places (four inside Elk Grove itself) and two
recurring markets. From Elk Grove the nearest listed place went from 59 miles
to 0.7.

Sources were found by search and filtered by hand. Two things that would have
shipped as errors without checking:

- The first results for "Elk Grove library storytime" are **Elk Grove Village,
  Illinois** — a different state entirely.
- The Elk Grove branch of Sacramento Public Library **stopped serving at its old
  address on 25 July 2026** and is relocating, with a grand opening given only
  as "early Fall 2026". No storytime is listed there, because it cannot be
  confirmed running.

The header label changed from "Bay Area" to "Northern California", which is now
the accurate description. The title and Open Graph copy still say Bay Area and
need a decision on branding.

## URL architecture

One page per city, at `/<city-slug>/`, with the root reduced to a city picker.

The reason a build step appeared, after "no build step" had been a stated virtue:
a city page needs its places sorted by distance *from that city*. Computing that
at build time rather than in the browser means each page ships genuinely
different, crawlable content, and the full list renders with JavaScript off.
`build.py` writes 38 city pages, the root, a sitemap and robots.txt; all of it is
committed, so Pages still serves plain static files and nothing runs on deploy.

Two guards exist because the stated long-term goal is ads, and ads mean traffic,
and traffic means these pages have to be worth indexing:

- **`MIN_PLACES` / `MAX_MILES`** — a city needs 4 places within 25 miles to get a
  page. Four towns don't qualify (Santa Rosa has none within 25 miles) and are
  skipped rather than published thin.
- **`LIST_MILES`** — a page lists only places within 40 miles. Without it all 38
  pages carry the same 30 places in a different order, which is the doorway-page
  pattern search engines demote. With it, Elk Grove lists 9 Sacramento places and
  Berkeley lists 17 Bay Area ones.

The root page carries both a `<select>` and a full list of `<a>` links. A
dropdown is not crawlable, so a picker alone would have left every city page
undiscoverable — the opposite of the point.

## Status

- Placeholder events **deleted** — they were invented, and this is a public URL.
- 21 real places remain, still hand-written in `index.html`; they migrate to
  `data/places.json` when the schema lands.
- Calendar engine renders an honest empty state with no events.

### POC shipped — decisions 6, 7, 8 proven

The consumer half now runs on the 21 real places:

- **Home location** (decision 6) — 41 Bay Area towns, stored in `localStorage`,
  never sent anywhere. Distances shown per place, list sorted nearest-first.
- **Shortlist** (decision 7) — top three, each stating *why* it was chosen
  ("1.6 mi away · indoors"). Respects the filters.
- **Weather** (decision 8) — Open-Meteo, client-side, reorders the shortlist.

Verified across all three weather states by intercepting the request: rain
promotes Chabot (indoor, 6.2 mi) above Tilden (outdoor, 2.4 mi) — the weighting
genuinely changes the answer, not just the label. With the request blocked, the
page silently falls back to distance-only, which is the path that actually runs
in this environment.

Coordinates are hand-entered approximations, accurate enough to rank 5 miles
against 40 (Berkeley→Lawrence Hall 1.6 mi, Berkeley→Gilroy 69.3 mi). The pipeline
replaces them with real geocoding; the map link stays authoritative.

**Still unproven: the pipeline itself** (decisions 1–4, 11), which is the part
that can actually kill the project. It cannot be built here — no outbound web, no
API key, and the Actions token is still clamped read-only.
