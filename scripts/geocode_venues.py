"""Geocode event venues so city pages can show how far each event is.

Events carry a venue name and a city but no coordinates, so a parent in Elk
Grove sees a storytime in North Highlands with no hint that it is a 20-minute
drive. This resolves each distinct (venue, city) once and writes the result to
data/venues.json, which build.py joins onto events at build time.

    python3 scripts/geocode_venues.py              # fill in what is missing
    python3 scripts/geocode_venues.py --recheck    # re-resolve everything
    python3 scripts/geocode_venues.py --dry-run    # list what it would look up

Stdlib only. Run it where the network reaches nominatim.openstreetmap.org --
the authoring sandbox blocks that host, the cron VM does not.

Two rules, because a wrong coordinate sends a family to the wrong side of the
county and this repo has shipped invented data once already:

  * Every entry records the query, the name Nominatim matched and the date it
    was resolved, so a bad match is auditable rather than anonymous.
  * A venue that cannot be resolved confidently is written with "lat": null and
    skipped by the build, which then shows no distance for it. Never a guess.

Existing entries are kept as-is unless --recheck is passed, so a hand-corrected
coordinate survives later runs. Add "locked": true to make one permanent.
